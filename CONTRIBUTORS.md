# Acknowledgement
CK team works closely with Meta [AITemplate](???to.be.added???) team ([Bing Xu](https://github.com/antinucleon), Ying Zhang, etc). Most of the lucrative graph optimization opportunities in ML models were identified by AITemplate team, and we also co-designed many high performance fused kernels for AMD GPUs. Without this collaboration, CK would not reach its current potential.
